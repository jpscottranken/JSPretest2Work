      <div id="bmiText">
        <p>
          Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and
          height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the
          square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2,
          resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m).
        </p>
        <p>
          The BMI may be determined first by measuring its components by means
          of a weighing scale and a stadiometer. The multiplication and division
          may be carried out directly, by hand or using a calculator, or
          indirectly using a lookup table (or chart).
        </p>
        <p>
          This table displays BMI as a function of mass and height and may show
          other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the
          calculation). The table may also show contour lines or colours for
          different BMI categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a
          person as based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.
          Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2),
          normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30
          or more).
        </p>
        <p>
          When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a
          statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can
          make it less useful than some of the alternatives, especially when
          applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or high
          muscle mass. BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with
          higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance
          from the 20â€“25 range.
