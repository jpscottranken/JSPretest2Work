        <p>
          This is a simple guessing game. First, a random number between 1 and
          100 is generated. This number is the number the user is supposed to
          guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          The person playing the game enters a number between 1 and 100 in the
          associated textbox. If s/he enters no input, non-numeric input, a
          guess less than 1, or a guess greater than 100, they are given an
          associated error message. The guess is not counted. The guess textbox
          is cleared and the focus is put on this textbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user enters a valid guess between 1 and 100 that is too low
          (less than the random number), they are given an appropriate message
          that tells them the guess was too low. The number of guesses is also
          incremented.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user enters a valid guess between 1 and 100 that is too high
          (greater than the random number), they are given an appropriate
          message that tells them the guess was too high. The number of guesses
          is also incremented.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user enters a valid guess between 1 and 100 that is correct
          (equals the random number), they are given an appropriate message that
          tells them that there guess is correct. They are also shown the total
          number of guesses made.
